# Building-extremely-powerful-object-recognizers-using-very-little-data
In this repository I will build a state of the art object recognizer with extremely small data. Remember, building a state of the art object recogniser using deep learning is very simple if you have large chunks of data. However, if we have very little data, how can we get the best out of our models? Let's find out!
